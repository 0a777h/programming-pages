The programming pages template is a collection of files designed to be dropped into your project as the basis of its documentation folder.

Installation is two steps:

1. Download the latest [release][releases]
1. Extract it into your project folder under `docs/`

Then use the template to:

1. [Author][author] your content
1. [Publish][publish] to GitHub Pages

You might want to consider keeping your authored documentation separate from the template files. This is generally a good idea, and can be accomplished with a simple build task that copies authored content from its source folders into the appropriate template folders.
